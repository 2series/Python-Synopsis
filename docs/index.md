Welcome to Python Synopsis!
===================

### Python Study Guide 


In this repository I want to share resources, that helped me understand python programing language deeply. 
It was not easy to find appropriate **books, articles, answers from Stackoverflow, online courses, videos from py conferences** and etc.   

So, after all I decided to share **top resources** for everyone about each topic, that you need to know about python, if you want to be senior python **Software Engineer**.   

Of course, it needs plenty of time to organize best resources based on the topics and it's hard for me to do it every day,  but I want to do min 1 chapter each week and now I think, that there will be more than **30-40** chapters.
